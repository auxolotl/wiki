# Repository Creation

## Naming
All names, including but not limited to CI Actions and Respository Names, must follow lower-kebab-case

## Structure
- All projects should provide a devnev if feasible, preferably in the form of direnv.
- All projects should provide a short summary as well as how to use the project in a top level README\.md
