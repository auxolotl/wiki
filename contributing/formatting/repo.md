# Naming
All names, including but not limited to CI Actions, Respositories, and folder names inside the project, must follow lower-kebab-case except in cases where a program requires something else.

# Structure
All projects should provide:
- A devnev when applicable, preferably in the form of direnv. 
- A short summary of what the project does, as well as how to use the project in a top level README.​md
	- The README should include a badge of who the repository is maintained by
- A CONTRIBUTING.​md file top level that tells people how to contribute to said project
