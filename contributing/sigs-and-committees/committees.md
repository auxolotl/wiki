# Committees

Committees handle the direction of the project in a particular area. For example, the Security Committee handles security in the whole project, setting guidelines for how SIGs should handle security.

The ideas for committees are inspired by [the kubernetes governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community).

## What Committees are there?

## SIG Meetings

SIG meetings are open to everyone, whether you're a part of the SIG or not. SIGs which hold regular meetings are listed below.

Meetings are also announced on their respective SIG category on the forum before they occur. Meeting announcements include an agenda, an up-to-date meeting link, and details such as schedule changes. We recommend treating them as fully authoritative for specific meetings and taking this table as a guide for meetings you may want to attend on a regular basis.

| SIG           | Meeting Time           | Meeting length | Join Link                                       |
