# Tutorials

Tutorials help you get started with Nix. They'll take you through the basics of what Nix is and how to use it, allowing you to learn Nix with little or no prior knowledge.

## [Ryan Yin's NixOS & Flakes Book](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world)

[Ryan Yin](https://github.com/ryan4yin)'s nix book is a great beginner guide to using Nix with flakes. It takes you from first principles through flakes. This is a missing area in the Nix documentation, as flakes are still experimental. Despite their experimental status, flakes are used in a lot of real-world projects and can make some tasks much easier, so it is still a good idea to learn about them.

## [nix.dev - Tutorials](https://nix.dev/tutorials/#tutorials)

[nix.dev](https://nix.dev) is an official resource, owned and maintained by the [NixOS documentation team](https://nixos.org/community/teams/documentation/). It has a section with tutorials which can get you up to speed on the language, packaging software, and NixOS modules.

## [Nix Pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/)

The [Nix Pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/) are a series of blog posts by [Luca Bruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lethalman/). They largely cover the usage of the Nix language and package manager, without frills such as NixOS.
