## What's a SIG?

SIGs, or "Special Interest Groups" are groups of people who focus on a particular area. They have specific projects and tasks with clear "things" as outcomes. For example, the Core Special Interest Group maintains vital packages and is involved in creating templates for new systems, and the Documentation Special Interest Group maintains the Wiki.

For more information on SIGs, what SIGs exist, and how to join one, please see [our full page on SIGs](/community/sigs).

## What's a committee?

Committees handle the direction of the project in a particular area. For example, the Security Committee handles security in the whole project, setting guidelines for how SIGs should handle security.

## What's the difference?

SIGs are generally more focused, looking at their tangible projects specifically. Committees might have whole-project reach by setting guidelines for how SIGs operate, and normally have less tangible task and project outcomes.

## Where does this come from?

The ideas for commitees and SIGs are inspired by [the kubernetes governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community). If you'd like to see how similar ideas work in practice we'd highly recommend looking at their community.
