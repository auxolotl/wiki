## What does this page contain?

This article goes over values that we have stated elsewhere such as our roadmap. Here we are building upon and clarifying those values. In perticualar, we look into each value, as well at the end of the stage 3 of the roadmap, "solidification". Why are we doing this? Beacuse accessiblity for directions is unclear, and we would like to expand on the roadmap, to provide clarification to those that seek it.

## What's our vision?

To create an alternative to nixpkgs. This alternative should be safer, kinder and more welcoming to contributors or new members. We should also run it in a way which ensures people's ideas are listened to and understood.

## What does a "minimum viable product" look like?

Our minimum viable product would be when we have a system running Aux on bare metal which can be powered on and launch to a desktop environment. This system must not depend on nixpkgs.
