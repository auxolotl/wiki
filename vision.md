## What does this page contain?

This article builds on and clarifies values we have stated elsewhere. In particular, we look into the values on our website and the "solidification" stage of the roadmap (stage 3).

We've written this page because the roadmap is a broad-strokes list. While it contains strands of a vision and a minimum viable product description, it doesn't clarify these fully.

## What's our vision?

We want to create an alternative to nixpkgs which, when combined with alternative evaluators such as [Lix](https://lix.systems), will allow you to fully replace any dependencies on [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS). This alternative should allow our contributors to be safe from discrimination or harassment. We should be welcoming to new members by providing solid documentation and a friendly and helpful community. Overall, we should foster a community that is kind to members, contributors and users. We should also run it in a way which ensures people's ideas are listened to and understood.

## What does a "minimum viable product" look like?

Our minimum viable product would be a system running Aux on bare metal. The system should be able to power on and launch to a desktop environment, such as KDE or Gnome. This system must not depend on nixpkgs.
