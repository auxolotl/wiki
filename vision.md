## What does this page contain?

This article builds on and clarifies values we have stated elsewhere. In particular, we look into the values on our website and the "solidification" stage of the roadmap (stage 3).

We've written this page because the roadmap is a broad-strokes list. It isn't clear in either values or measurable deliverables.

## What's our vision?

To create an alternative to nixpkgs. This alternative should be safer, kinder and more welcoming to contributors or new members. We should also run it in a way which ensures people's ideas are listened to and understood.

## What does a "minimum viable product" look like?

Our minimum viable product would be a system running Aux on bare metal. The system should be able to power on and launch to a desktop environment, such as KDE or Gnome. This system must not depend on nixpkgs.
