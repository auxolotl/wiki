# Communication
SIG: Core has a few different ways we can communicate. You can use any of the following:
- Send a message to [[FILL_IN] - General on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#SIGCORE-GEN:auxolotl.org)
- View and comment on ongoing topics in the [Discourse Category](https://forum.aux.computer/c/special-interest-groups/sig-core/14)
