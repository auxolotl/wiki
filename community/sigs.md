# Special Interest Groups

SIGs, or "Special Interest Groups" are groups of people who focus on a particular area. They have specific projects and tasks with clear "things" as outcomes. For example, the Core Special Interest Group maintains vital packages and is involved in creating templates for new systems, and the Documentation Special Interest Group maintains the Wiki.

The ideas for SIGs are inspired by [the kubernetes governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community).

## SIG Meetings

SIG meetings are open to everyone, whether you're a part of the SIG or not. SIGs which hold regular meetings are listed below.

Meetings are also announced on their respective SIG category on the forum before they occur. Meeting announcements include an agenda, an up-to-date meeting link, and details such as schedule changes. We recommend treating them as fully authoritative for specific meetings and taking this table as a guide for meetings you may want to attend on a regular basis.
